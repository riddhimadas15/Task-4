# Task-4
I have created a Power BI interactive dashboard named task_4.pbix which contains all the necessary menus and options required for business decisions including:
-> Summary cards
-> Filters
-> Interactive map visualisation
-> Bar char
-> Pie chart
-> Line chart
-> Goal tracker
Apart from that a .ppt file called task_4.pptx contains the summaries and important explanations of the various options. The PoweBI dataset has also been attached.
